<h2>What is Queue Sync?</h2>
Queuesync is a website that allows you to create a room that is linked to a Spotify account.  People can then join this room using the unique room code and add songs to the room admin's Spotify queue.  This allows multiple people to contribute to the music they are listening, which is especially useful for parties, carpools, and group events!
<h2>What was it built with?</h2>
The frontend was built with HTML,CSS, and Javascript while the backend was built with Express.js and utilized the Spotify API
