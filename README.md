<h2>Inspiration</h2>
During a long car ride, one person is often designated as "aux."  That person can take suggestions but essentially has total control of the music.  At HackTCNJ, we decided to do make something so everyone can have a choice in the music.
<h2>What is Queue Sync?</h2>
Queuesync is a website that allows you to create a room that is linked to a Spotify account.  People can then join this room using the unique room code and add songs to the room admin's Spotify queue.  This allows multiple people to contribute to the music that they are listening to, which is especially useful for parties, carpools, and group events!
<h2>What was it built with?</h2>
The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and the backend was built with <span><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.JS</a></span> and utilized the <span><a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a></span>.

  <li>Update tracks display tracks playing on load, not just after adding</li>
  <li>Tell user when a room does not exist</li>
  <li>Code Cleanup</li>
</ul>
